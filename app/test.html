      <p class="ok_h1"><span class="Char2Override-20">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">The United Kingdom has been a leader in the open data movement – a new movement by governments around the world to open up the vast repositories of data they hold across agencies and departments, and to collect new kinds of data for public use. Open data is publicly available data that can be universally and readily accessed, used, and redistributed free of charge. It is changing the way governments, nonprofits, and the private sector use data to understand public issues and solve problems in areas as diverse as financial regulation, energy, education, and more.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open data holds particular potential in the health sector. By releasing health data and structuring it for usability and computability (all while protecting privacy) governments and healthcare organizations are betting on the power of open data to improve the quality of care, lower healthcare costs, and facilitate patient choice. The NHS has made and continues to make significant investments in open data. Over the past several years, it has launched a series of open data initiatives that have already had a positive impact on patient education, healthcare choice, healthcare costs, and patient outcomes. Now the NHS is planning a broader, more ambitious programme that has the potential to serve as a worldwide model for the use of open data in healthcare. The purpose of this report is to help design this programme, establishing priorities and ways of measuring impact so as to guide this and future efforts at data transparency. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Using open data in healthcare offers several potential benefits. This report examines the current literature, drawing on case studies and published research to highlight the following value propositions for open data in health:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Accountability:</span> The use of data to hold healthcare organizations and providers accountable for treatment outcomes.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Choice:</span> Providing open data to help patients make informed choices from among the healthcare options available to them.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Efficiency:</span> Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Outcomes:</span> Improving treatment outcomes by using open data to make the results of different treatments, healthcare organizations, and providers’ work more transparent.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Patient satisfaction and customer service:</span> Using open data to educate patients and their families and make healthcare institutions more responsive.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Economic growth and innovation:</span> Using open data to fuel new healthcare companies and initiatives, and to spur innovation in the broader economy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_text">Despite widespread recognition of these value propositions, there is little understanding of how best to achieve them, and especially how to measure the impact of open data initiatives. One of the central goals of this paper is to establish a conceptual framework, or logic model, that will help researchers and programme managers design their initiatives and measure their impact. The paper outlines the components of such a framework, linking specific inputs and activities with their impacts and indicators that can be used for measurement. The conceptual framework also discusses a variety of methodologies that can be employed to facilitate measurement and impact analysis. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Overall, this draft blueprint from the GovLab describes the need for careful assessment of healthcare open data initiatives and outlines an approach that can help in such an assessment. The approach helps both in assessing the opportunities of open data, and also in considering potential risks and challenges.  Though there has been significant discussion about the concerns and risks emerging from open data, there has been little research into its potential economic and social benefits. In today’s budgetary climate, we need to enhance our ability to marshal evidence on the efficacy of innovative and potentially important new programmes, while at the same time taking into account the societal and other risks (e.g., to privacy) that may accompany such programmes.  By laying out a research agenda to accompany the NHS’s open data strategy, our hope is to ensure that public investments in open data are supported by concrete evidence of its value, and that this, in turn, can be used to guide and develop the NHS’s ambitious plans to shift an entire nation’s bureaucracy to more evidence-based decision-making. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">In conclusion, this report recommends that the NHS create an <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Open Data Learning Environment (ODLE)</span> that combines the use of innovative technology platforms, robust consultation with a wide array of stakeholders, close partnerships with the research community, and fellowships to bring innovators into the NHS. We make ten specific recommendations for the creation of this ODLE, which would facilitate ongoing assessment of progress against goals, rather than simply offering a one-time snapshot of results. Taken together, these recommendations would help the NHS improve and refine its use of open data in a nimble, real-time fashion.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">To create the proposed ODLE, we recommend that the NHS:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Build an Open Data Learning Capacity and Culture</span> within the NHS. This can include a number of steps to institutionalize action and learning about open data, such as creating a corps of volunteers with technical knowledge, setting up an Open Health Data Academy, soliciting calls for questions from the academic community, and posing challenges and offering prizes for the best uses of open health data. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Engage the public in defining metrics</span> of success with regard to open data. In addition to ensuring that direct stakeholders (e.g., patients and providers) are included in decisions about open data, the NHS may also want to consider allowing citizens to participate – for example, though a citizens’ open health data panel. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Stay focused on what really matters</span>. The NHS should use metrics that reflect how open data impacts people’s lives, using surveys, social media, or NHS Open Data Stories both to gather examples and evaluate their significance. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Develop a common assessment framework</span> with partners in other sectors and countries to measure the impact of open health data, using meetings, online communication, and additional tools. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Stay flexible and adaptive in measuring impact</span>.  As the use of open data evolves and becomes more dispersed, the NHS will need to find a balance between a centralized measurement function (which sets measurement standards, aggregates data across programmes, and monitors data quality) and a more diffused structure that empowers users at different levels of the organization. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Share what is learned (including failures) with everyone</span>. By sharing what is learned (including mistakes and failures) on a regular basis, the NHS can enable distributed oversight and peer review mechanisms to ensure the quality of its research and enhance the way open data is used. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Build a research network and expert network</span> to build capacity quickly and broker debate around methodology and findings. Outside expertise, gathered through meetings, online input, or an advisory board, will be critical in determining the best ways to assess impact.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Develop an open health data ecology map,</span> possibly using crowdsourcing, with a dictionary of all open health data sets used along with the variety of uses and users.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Publish, integrate and fine-tune the open data conceptual framework</span> for feedback and improvement, using expert advisors and input from stakeholders. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Engage citizens and practitioners in shaping the open health data programme.</span> The NHS should engage key stakeholders on a regular basis to determine which datasets have the highest priority for them; what new datasets should be released as open data; and which open data collections are particularly easy or difficult to use. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">We are releasing this as a draft in order to encourage discussion and additional insights from interested readers. We welcome your comments and suggestions, and look forward to incorporating them into a subsequent version of the report. </span></p>

      <p class="ok_h1">Introduction </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">In a recent study, a company called Mastodon C, based at the Open Data Institute in Shoreditch and working in conjunction with Ben Goldacre and Open Healthcare, analyzed massive amounts of data on prescription patterns released by the National Health Service. The analysis found significant geographic variations across England, with expensive prescription drugs being prescribed in some areas when generics would work just as well. If the findings of the study were applied to change prescription patterns, the savings could amount to more than 1 billion GBP per year.<span class="Char2Override-24"><a id="footnote-29809-2-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-2">2</a></span> </li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Nine years ago, the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgeons began publishing the results of surgeries done by individual physicians across the UK. Surgical outcomes improved rapidly, and a report by the Society stated that “we believe that the marked, sustained, incremental improvement in the quality of care the surgical teams have achieved is directly associated with the process of recording, reporting and publishing outcomes at the level of the individual clinician.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-3-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-3">3</a></span></li>
        <li class="ok_ul">The National Health Service has begun doing a “friends and family” study, using well-established survey methods to ask patients and their families whether they would recommend a particular hospital or care center. By publishing these “friends and family” ratings, the NHS hopes to give consumers more information and choice, and in the process improve the quality of care they receive.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-4-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-4">4</a></span> </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_text">These examples, and many others we discuss in this report, are beginning to show the power of “open data” in healthcare. In recent years, a growing number of governments --from cities to states to regions -- have committed to opening up the vast repositories of data they hold across agencies and departments, and in many cases to collecting new kinds of data for public use. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of this open data revolution. According to two third-party measures, the Open Data Index<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-5-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-5">5</a></span> and the Open Data Barometer,<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-6-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-6">6</a></span> the UK is ahead of other developed countries (including the US, Australia and France) when it comes to the “reach” of its open data (measured by visits to and incoming links at the main open data websites).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-7-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-7">7</a> </span>In the words of one leading UK official, the government has committed to “unleash a tsunami of data.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-8-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-8">8</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Healthcare is one of the sectors with the potential to be most radically transformed by greater data transparency. Indeed, many of the most important steps taken by the UK government with regard to open data involve open health data. In recent years, the NHS has invested substantial resources (financial and intellectual) into developing a comprehensive open data strategy. Information concerning GP prescribing, mortality rates, waiting times, and a wide variety of other data has been released to the public and researchers. An incipient ecology of innovation, analysis and research has begun to emerge as a result of such initiatives. Overall, the NHS’s efforts with regard to open data have the potential to transform the delivery and experience of healthcare, spurring greater efficiencies, more innovation, and, perhaps most importantly, better health outcomes for patients.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The philosophical (or ethical) argument for open data can be explained by two principles. First, information whose collection is paid for by taxpayers should be available to those taxpayers; second, personal information about individuals (e.g., medical data) should likewise be accessible to those individuals. There is also an instrumental rationale for open data, which is that raw datasets lend themselves to computation and algorithmic analysis. What makes open data potentially transformative is the fact that it facilitates third parties to use it in ways that create new analyses, visualizations, and mash ups. This kind of innovation can transform raw data into knowledge. Solving complex challenges requires many people with diverse skills and talents to work together.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-9-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-9">9</a></span> When experts of all kinds have access to open data, it becomes a catalyst for creative problem solving and community innovation. “The real value [of open data] comes from interpretation, analysis, linking-up and reflection – in short, from being used,” says one database expert. “Keeping hold of data that you don’t use much is wasting potential. By making data open, you enable others to bring fresh perspectives, insights, and additional resources to your data, and that’s when it can become really valuable.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-10-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-10">10</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Today, the potential of open health data is widely recognized. Researchers, journalists and of course healthcare providers celebrate an opportunity to improve efficiency of service delivery, catalyze provider accountability, and help patients make more informed choices about their care. Yet much of this promise is still anecdotal and unproven. There is a dearth of systematic analysis and solid, empirical data. It remains very difficult to measure the value of open data interventions, and by extension to decide which initiatives are worth pursuing and which not.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The central premise of this paper is that as the NHS moves to release data systematically, it needs to put in place a strategy for measuring the value of open data for the various stakeholders involved in the nation’s healthcare system—and, indeed, for citizens in general. In today’s budgetary climate, it is not enough to assess the value of expensive and complicated government programmes after the fact. We need to enhance our ability to marshal an arsenal of evidence in order to protect investments in innovative and potentially important new programmes. By becoming more agile in how we measure innovations in governance like open data, we can make government more efficient, and more effective.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">To aid in this goal, this draft whitepaper articulates recommendations for the NHS to follow as it seeks to measure the impact of open data empirically. By laying out a research agenda to accompany the NHS’s open data strategy, our hope is to ensure that public investment in open data is supported by concrete evidence of its value, which, in turn, can be used to guide and evolve the ambitious plan to shift an entire nation’s bureaucracy to more evidence-based decision-making. We are releasing this as a draft in order to encourage discussion and additional insights from interested readers.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The paper is divided into four parts: </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Part I </span>explains open data as a driver of innovation. We summarize the open data plans of the NHS, including the data the NHS holds, what it is planning to release and when, and the challenges to implementing a nationwide open data plan.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Part II </span>lays out the arguments in favor of using open data in a healthcare setting (six value propositions), such as improving patient choice and strengthening provider accountability, and outlines the empirical evidence we currently have in support of each.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Part III</span> presents a series of metrics that can help the NHS measure its performance and improve its use of open data. It establishes a conceptual framework to use for continuously evolving and accelerating the ability to measure the impact of open data in healthcare. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Char2Override-25">Finally </span><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Part IV</span><span class="Char2Override-25"> concludes with specific principles and recommendations to establish an Open Data Learning Environment (ODLE)--the practices and platforms by which to operationalize agile assessment and enable programme evolution.</span></p>
      <p class="ok_h1 _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Char2Override-27">Part I</span><span class="Char2Override-28"> <br />The Open Data Era</span></p>
      <p class="ok_h1">I.1<span class="Char2Override-30"> </span>Health Data and the Open Data Revolution</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The last decade or so has seen a data explosion around the world. In late 2012, it was estimated that there existed some 2.8 zettabytes (2.8 trillion GB) of data; this was expected to grow to 40ZB by 2020.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-11-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-11">11</a></span> Until recently, much of this data was closed to public access--hidden behind firewalls and passwords, protected by copyright or other legal barriers. In addition, some of the data was kept from the public due to legitimate concerns over privacy or national security.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Recent years have witnessed something of a sea change in the way data is treated, particularly by governments and (to a lesser extent) private companies. Across the world, there has been a gradual—and sometimes not so gradual--transition underway from what McKinsey calls a culture of “protect” to one of “share, with protections.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-12-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-12">12</a></span> With this transition comes huge opportunity. It is estimated that open data could help unlock $3-$5 trillion globally.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-13-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-13">13</a></span> In the EU27 economy, the value of open data was calculated to be €32 billion in 2010, with a 7% annual growth rate (see Appendix I for additional statistics).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-14-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-14">14</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_text">It is this move towards greater data transparency that marks what some observers have called an open data revolution. But just what is open data? Open data is often confused with another information science trend that has received significant media attention: Big Data. The two trends are related, but not identical.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">There is no single, universally accepted definition of open data. In order to develop a working definition, the GovLab assembled nine current definitions (Appendix II) and placed them within a framework for comparative analysis (Appendix II: Table 1). The resulting definition, a synthesis that guides our discussion in this paper, is as follows:</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Open data is publicly available data that can be universally and readily accessed, used, and redistributed free of charge. Open data is released in ways that protects private, personal or proprietary information. It is structured for usability and computability.</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text _idGenParaOverride-1">Ultimately, the <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">openness</span> of open data depends on the development of standards and best practices to guide the way data is presented and organized. The goal in opening data is to make it easier to find the data, present it in usable formats, and streamline terminology when possible. This will ensure that data is not only accessible, but also that it is readable, comprehensible and usable by a wide range of individuals. To achieve these goals, data should be: (1) published in a standard format; (2) published without proprietary conditions; and (3) available online in a downloadable format.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-15-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-15">15</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Today, some forty countries have developed open data policies.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-16-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-16">16</a></span> These policies vary in the extent to which they meet these three conditions or match our working definition. Almost all , however, are motivated by efforts to break down existing silos and bureaucratic barriers across a wide range of information categories. Open data policies today apply to a variety of different kinds of information, including information related to land records, welfare schemes, and political operations and fundraising that can be accessed and used, is non-personally identifiable (through anonymization or pseudonymization), and is structured for usability and release, without restrictions of copyright or other mechanisms of control. There is reason to believe, however, that data transparency might prove to be a particularly revolutionary tool when it is applied to health information. As the six value propositions we discuss below suggest, health data might in some respects prove to be a unique category of information. Around the world, providers, researchers, and policy makers are articulating a new vision that some have begun to call “Health 2.0” or “Medicine 2.0”—a vision of coordinated, patient-centered healthcare that leverages data and technology to engage patients, integrate providers, and improve clinical outcomes. At the same time, health data poses certain challenges—particularly concerning privacy and identity—that require treatment with particular sensitivity and, at times, even restrictions. We also discuss these challenges below.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">In truth, health data—like all data—exists on a continuum from open to closed. In this paper, we suggest three categories on this continuum of “openness:” </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">1 - Open Health Data: </span>Currently open data is published under the Open Government License, and is available through the <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Data.gov.uk</span> site, and through the Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre at <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">HSCIC.gov.uk, </span><span class="OK_italic Char2Override-31">Public Health England,</span><span class="Char2Override-32"><a id="footnote-29809-17-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-17">17</a></span> and other sites (see Appendix V for a complete list of data types and locations). Open data is made publicly available, in a user-friendly, interactive, or downloadable format. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">2 - Semi-Open Health Data: </span>Data that potentially carries personal or proprietary information, which is anonymized through the removal of personally identifying information. Researchers or companies can then request this data, though they may have to pay an additional fee to access the data, as well as fulfill additional criteria determined by the NHS.  </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">3 - Published Health Data: </span>Data that has been published in a particular format by the NHS or other governmental entities. This data is generally prepared for presentation in an interactive, .doc, or PDF format and the original data files are not included in the release. An example of published data would be NHS patient satisfaction surveys.  </p>
      <p class="ok_text">These categories have been developed through an analysis of health data as it is currently released through the NHS. What both the NHS and the HSCIC currently consider under the umbrella of “open health data” is limited, but eventually can come to include a greater variety and quantity of datasets throughout the NHS open data initiative. </p>
      <p class="ok_h1">I.2 The NHS and Open Data: Where We Stand</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of global efforts to open up the data in governance, and especially in healthcare. The government’s 2012 <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">White Paper on Open Data</span> begins with these ambitious words: “Data is the 21st century’s new raw material. Its value is in holding governments to account; in driving choice and improvements in public services; and in inspiring innovation and enterprise that spurs social and economic growth.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-18-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-18">18</a></span> By the end of 2012, it was estimated that there were some 37,500 datasets publicly available on the UK government’s main data sites, including <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Data.gov.uk</span>, <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Ons.gov.uk, </span>and a variety of other local data stores including <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Data.London.gov.uk. </span>In total, there had been some 2.7 million downloads from these sites.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-19-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-19">19</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">From the beginning, the health sector and the NHS have been identified as priority areas for data initiatives. In fact, systematic collection of data in the NHS can be traced to the 1980s, long before current interest in open data or big data. It wasn’t until the 1990s, however, that a more robust data collection framework was established. Even then, the decision to upgrade and refine the way data was collected was driven not so much by a desire for increased transparency as by efforts to achieve greater economic efficiencies and introduce “internal markets” within the NHS. Such efforts were part of the government’s New Public Management (NPM) policies, and were designed to foster competition inside the NHS, separating out “providers” from “purchasers.” These efforts grew during the early 2000s, when NHS organizations were required to collect many more kinds of data, including information on waiting times, performance evaluation of general practitioners, names of patients with diabetes and strokes, and adverse events, which were reported to the National Patient Safety Agency.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-20-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-20">20</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_text">In the last decade or so, the NHS has expanded its commitment to collecting and publishing open health data. <span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">The table “NHS Open Data Milestones” </span> includes some key initiatives undertaken by the NHS and its partners. Two broad points stand out in particular. The first is a renewed commitment to data transparency following the election of the coalition government in 2010, a commitment that marks continuity with the previous government’s initiatives and thus a cross-party consensus on the value of open data. The current government’s commitment has been evident in a range of research and publications, notably the <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">White Paper on Open Data </span>and <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">The Power of Information</span> (both published in 2012), and the passage of the Health and Social Care Act of 2012, which placed open data and data transparency at the core of the government’s healthcare strategy.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">In addition, a hallmark of the UK’s data transparency policies (and arguably one of the key reasons for their success) has been third-party innovation. Current government and NHS policies call for de-identified data to be made available to researchers and industry in order to encourage such innovation.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-21-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-21">21</a></span> As a result, many new data-driven businesses have been developed with the support and collaboration of government agencies. For example, the Open Data Institute (a non-profit company seeded with £10 million of public money) has incubated several new companies. Likewise, Dr Foster Intelligence, which provides health-related information and research to the public, such as hospital and consultant guides, is now partially owned by the Department of Health.</p>
      <p class="ok_h3">NHS OPEN DATA MILESTONES</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">In 2005, the NHS Information Centre was established to be the authoritative repository of NHS health information, making a wide range of data available to providers, researchers and patients.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-22-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-22">22</a></span> </li>
        <li class="ok_ul">In 2007, NHS Choices was launched, empowering patients to make decisions about their healthcare based on comparative data about hospitals and GPs while offering information about conditions, treatments and healthy living. Users were also able to share their experiences of using NHS services. Currently, the site attracts 35 million monthly visits and studies have indicated its important (and largely positive) role in changing patient behavior.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-23-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-23">23</a></span> </li>
        <li class="ok_ul">After the 2010 elections, the newly elected coalition government also gave priority to data transparency--including open health data--in a series of policy statements and choices, notably the White Paper on Open Data of 2012. In 2011, the Prime Minister David Cameron made his commitment to open data clear in a speech he delivered to a pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference:<p class="ok_indent _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">“Now there’s something else that we’re doing... and that is opening up the vast amounts of data generated in our health service.  From this month huge amounts of new data are going to be released online.  This is the real world evidence that scientists have been crying out for and we’re determined to deliver it.  We’ve seen how powerful the release of data can be... It is simply a waste to have a health system like the NHS and not to do this kind of thing.  So we don’t want to stop there... Because believe me, we’re determined to convert these words and policy papers into action</span><span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">.”</span><span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-24-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-24">24</a></span></p></li>
        <li class="ok_ul">In 2012, the new Health and Social Care Act placed open data and data transparency at the core of its healthcare strategy. Among other things, it required the Health and Social Care Information Centre to release virtually all of the data it possessed (in anonymized form). Eighty-three new datasets were subsequently released as part of this requirement.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Also in 2012, the NHS published its new IT strategy, a ten-year plan called The Power of Information. The document promised, among other things, that “all health and care records held by hospitals and other service providers will be made securely available to patients;” and made a commitment that “by 2015, anyone in England will be able to access their GP health record online as well as book appointments with their GP or request repeat prescriptions online.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-25-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-25">25</a></span> </li>
        <li class="ok_ul">In September 2013, the NHS launched the CareConnect Pilot, a phone and web service that allows citizens to interact with the NHS, get information, and provide real-time data through feedback and other mechanisms. The NHS has also announced its intention to launch a multi-channel customer service platform, the Health and Social Care Digital Service. Locally, the NHS developed a series of websites geared towards localities or regional healthcare needs (for example addressing dementia in South West England), such as <span class="Char2Override-34">NHSLocal.nhs.uk</span> (now closed) and <span class="Char2Override-34">MyHealthLondon.nhs.uk</span>.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">The UK is benefitting from other open data initiatives around the world. In January, 2014, the Secretary of State for Health, NHS England, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Health and Human Services, recognizing the importance of establishing a collaboration to allow both countries to learn from the experiences of the other, and to align their approaches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h3">LOOKING FORWARD</p>
      <p class="ok_text">In particular, the policies and data architecture implemented over the past decade have laid the foundations for three main objectives: releasing more data; expanding datasets to measure health outcomes; and making data actionable for healthcare consumers. These priorities, already evident in recent initiatives, are likely to define the NHS’ open data efforts going forward.  </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Releasing more open data:</span> Motivated in part by the success of publishing comparable data for cardiac surgical outcomes, England began in July 2013 publishing surgery outcome data for 10 major specialties.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-26-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-26">26</a></span> In February 2014, Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, noted that these efforts would be taken even further with hospitals being asked to publish monthly staffing ratios, on a ward-by-ward basis.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-27-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-27">27</a></span> These initiatives reflect the NHS’ ongoing commitment to the release of more open data that can be used by patients, physicians and commissioners to compare the quality of care delivered across the NHS. </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Expanding datasets to measure health outcomes: </span>The 2014/15 Outcomes Framework released by the Department of Health reiterates the commitment established in the 2010 White Paper, <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Liberating the NHS,</span> to shift the focus from measuring process targets to health outcomes.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-28-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-28">28</a></span> In addition to re-focusing data collections on health indicators, NHS plans to transform the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) into Care Episode Statistics (CES) by linking hospital datasets to a wide range of other datasets including primary care data, community health services data, clinical audit data, cancer registry data, social care data, mental health data, and, for those who wish to donate it, genomic data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-29-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-29">29</a></span> This effort, known as Care.Data, will enrich data sources by collecting more granular data on all aspects of care received within hospitals, and will link clinical data collected throughout the NHS.  </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Making data actionable for healthcare consumers: </span>As part of an effort to move towards<span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1"> </span>patient-centered and customer-focused care, the NHS is redesigning its publication systems to better meet the needs of individual patients. For example, the NHS is revamping its NHS Choices website to add feedback and transactional functionality. In addition, the new Health and Social Care Digital Service will be designed to offer enhanced functionality to the public through several mechanisms, including online appointment booking and prescription refills, secure connections to personal health records, and better social media integration as well as greater use of patient social networks.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-30-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-30">30</a>,<a id="footnote-29809-31-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-31">31</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Together, these recent initiatives act in concert to help the NHS achieve greater transparency and improve health outcomes. They define the parameters and contours of the NHS’s open data thinking, and help give direction to a data transparency strategy to guide the coming years. </p>

      <p class="ok_Footnote-text ParaOverride-15">- President Barack Obama</p>
      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-14">On his first day in office, President Obama signed the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, declaring the data maintained by the Federal government to be a national asset and calling for its rapid disclosure. The Department of Health and Human Services was among the first agencies to begin sharing public health. Since then, the Health Data Initiative has posted nearly 1,000 datasets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Administration for Children and Families, and other agencies on a dedicated health data website called <span class="Char2Override-34">HealthData.gov</span>.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-32-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-32">32</a></span>  These datasets include, among others, data that has been provided from publicly sponsored organizations such as Medicare and Medicaid, and other organizational data at the hospital, regional and state levels. </p>
      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-14">Through its open data program, the HDI hopes to spur innovation and promote a culture of data openness and transparency, as well as to demonstrate how data can be used responsibly, privately and securely.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-33-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-33">33</a></span>  The strategy relies heavily on private sector collaboration. To that end, Health and Human Services has inspired the launching of “datapaloozas” to showcase those who are using the data to solve problems.

      <p class="ok_h2">II.1.1. Accountability</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Proposition:</span> Opening data can enable accountability at the political and economic levels, helping to ensure that health regulators are meeting standards, and that physicians and hospitals are held accountable for unwanted variation and poor practices (for example, in the number of individuals dying from preventable diseases).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-37-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-37">37</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Evidence from the Literature: </span>Open data has a powerful role to play in ensuring that healthcare providers and regulators are held accountable for the quality of care they provide. Public access to performance data can provide important indications of variability in cost or quality of healthcare, allowing patients to make more informed decisions, and regulators to take necessary action. One well-known example concerns the publication by the New York State Cardiac Surgery Reporting System of hospital mortality rates following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A number of subsequent studies found that the publication of this data increased market share for hospitals with lower mortality rates. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the availability of the data served as something of a “shaming mechanism,” encouraging hospitals with higher mortality rates to change their practices and achieve improved outcomes.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-38-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-38">38</a> </span>Similarly, an analysis of forty-five peer-reviewed articles, published in the <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Annals of Internal Medicine</span>, found evidence linking the public release of data to quality improvements in hospitals.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-39-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-39">39</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Increasing data transparency appears to have a particularly powerful role on the behavior of regulators. In the United Kingdom, a series of news stories based on public data brought to light the fact that the number of elderly patients dying from dehydration had doubled, and that the number killed by superbugs had risen by seven times between 1997 and 2010. Also in the United Kingdom, a doctor (unaffiliated with the NHS) used public data in 2009 to find that a hospital in Stafford had unusually high mortality rates. In each case, the revelations led to enquiries and subsequent actions by NHS regulators.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-40-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-40">40</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Concern does exist over the quality of data and the criteria used to measure quality. Data can be particularly problematic (and misleading) when it is based on subjective criteria or patient self-reporting. In addition, an over-reliance on quality indicators and rankings can skew incentives and behaviors among providers in ways that are not necessarily beneficial to patients.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-41-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-41">41</a></span> Such concerns are, without a doubt, valid. However, they argue not so much against the use of data for accountability, but rather make a case for more thought being put into how data is collected, designed and disseminated. We discuss issues related to data quality below.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Organizations affiliated with the NHS have already instituted a set of practices geared towards increasing accountability at the organizational and clinical levels through the use of public data, specifically audits. Using a clinical auditing process (including a critical analysis of national audit reports and findings from an online survey of NHS Trusts England), Christopher Loughlan and the Cambridge Institute for Research, Education and Management (CiREM) showed how audits can lead to changes in practice and greater adherence to published recommendations or guidelines.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-42-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-42">42</a></span> Loughlin found that these audits resulted in a number of positive outcomes, including increased prescription quality, patient management, reductions in patient harms, and resource allocation.</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Taxonomy: </span>As <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Table II.1</span> illustrates, within accountability, there are a number of distinctions that can be made, which should be considered in any discussion of the impact of open data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-43-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-43">43</a></span></p>

      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Proposition:</span> Open data on patient experience and health outcomes will allow patients to seek out the services that best meet their individual healthcare needs. Furthermore, increased access to health data will allow patients to choose among many providers and treatments, in turn driving patient satisfaction, quality improvements and the enhancement of standards in many areas within the NHS. </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Evidence from the Literature: </span>Greater public access to data and information has increased consumer choice in a range of sectors, ranging from travel to finance to shopping. A similar enhancement of choice can be expected with regard to healthcare. Indeed, patient choice is an essential driver of quality and efficiency in healthcare. In the UK, this fact was recognized as far back as 2002, when the then Secretary of State for Health Alan Milburn stated that “choice is the primary means by which you can drive the NHS to focus on the needs of its individual members.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-50-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-50">50</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">There now exists widespread evidence that data does indeed influence the way patients seek healthcare, expanding their options and the range of sources from which they seek information. It has long been established, for instance, that medical information on the Internet plays a role in influencing patients’ decisions, in some cases an even bigger role than that played by their doctors.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-51-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-51">51</a></span> A recent survey of 6,000 patients in the US<span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21"> </span>found that nearly half (48.6%) went to the Internet first for information on cancer (compared to 10.9% who went to their doctor).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-52-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-52">52</a> </span>Likewise, a Pew Internet and American Life Project found that of the people who turned to the Internet for healthcare information, more than half reported that it influenced their treatment decision.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-53-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-53">53</a></span> A recent survey on the impact of NHS Choices (nhs.uk) similarly finds a range of evidence to suggest that the availability of medical data plays a significant role in influencing how patients seek care.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-54-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-54">54</a></span> Jeremy Hunt, the UK Secretary of State for Health has emphasized the importance of using data to provide patients with choices, arguing that “there is the business of healthcare but underneath all of this there is something much more important, which is putting people in control of the data that affects the single thing that matters more to them and their families…their healthcare.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-55-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-55">55</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open data can be particularly helpful in aiding patients in the access of information that will allow them to evaluate different treatment programmes. Open health data in this area should support the guidelines outlined in the NHS 2013/14 Choice Framework.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-56-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-56">56</a> </span>In fact, the policy of offering patients a choice regarding where and from whom they receive hospital treatment was implemented by the NHS already in 2006, in order to drive up competition between providers and encourage efficiency and responsiveness.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-57-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-57">57</a> </span>Results from a study assessing the effectiveness of choice programmes showed that quality assessments will become more important in influencing patient decisions and choices as quality-related information is made more readily available. Recognizing this, NHS England has made a commitment to facilitating shared decision making between patients and their physicians, through embedding it as an objective within the NHS Constitution and the NHS Mandate.<span class="Char2Override-40"><a id="footnote-29809-58-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-58">58</a></span> <span class="OK_sup _idGenChar2Override-2"> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">The link between data-influenced choices and positive outcomes is somewhat more complicated. Evidence does exist to suggest that data can have a positive influence. An NHS survey concluded that 37% of patients who used the NHS Choices website witnessed an appropriate decrease in GP consultations, and that this translated into savings of approximately £44 million a year. Based on an analysis of data conducted during the Swine Flu panic of 2009, the study also concluded that availability of data could be particularly helpful during epidemic and public services by limiting demand for medical services.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-59-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-59">59</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">It is however important to note that a growing body of evidence also suggests the information on its own may not always lead patients to make better (or more informed) medical decisions.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-60-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-60">60</a></span> This may be because, as Neil Manson and Onora O’Neill point out, patients are not always “rational” decision makers. In many cases, it may also have to do with limited numeracy skills, or limited ability to analyze and understand vast amounts of medical data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-61-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-61">61</a> </span>Thus while recent years have witnessed a move towards more “patient-centered” practices, there is also a growing appreciation of the need for “shared decision-making” approaches.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-62-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-62">62</a></span> Such approaches combine data-driven and information-armed patients with the clinical judgment of doctors. In such approaches, the presentation of data and its integration with structured “decision aids” can be critical.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-63-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-63">63</a> </span></p>

      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Proposition:</span> The availability of open data will prompt NHS organizations to be more cost-effective, will accelerate data-sharing practices and communication strategies, and will improve care quality. Comparative data regarding efficiency across hospitals and administrations can be used to develop best practices and better standards. The impact of open data on efficiency places a special importance on the organizational setting of healthcare, including purchasing, labour, and professional practices.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-64-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-64">64</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Evidence from the Literature: </span>Open data has a vital role to play in lowering costs, reducing fraud and increasing productivity—all vital steps towards creating a more efficient healthcare system. With healthcare today consuming ever-larger shares of national GDP (9.3% in the UK, 17.9% in the US),<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-65-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-65">65</a></span> finding a way to achieve greater efficiencies without negatively affecting outcomes is a major public policy priority. Whereas accountability focuses on broader, macro-level indicators of spending and costs, efficiency examines data between hospitals, clinics, and regions of the NHS, to identify areas of concern. These measures go beyond cost and distribution of resources, to include rates of treatment (including drug prescriptions, surgical operations, etc.), and the use of systems that enable better communication between healthcare practitioners and across agencies. Efficiency also encompasses other areas, such as wait-times and management of health records. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Numerous examples exist in which public access to data has identified or could potentially identify significant cost savings. In one widely publicized instance (mentioned in the introduction), Mastodon C and Open Healthcare UK (two startups) worked in collaboration with Ben Goldacre, a journalist and doctor, to examine data sets containing GP prescriptions for generic and patented statins in England. By examining regional variations, they were able to identify potential savings of £200 million.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-66-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-66">66</a></span> Similarly, a study conducted by McKinsey concluded that using open data to assist patients with chronic conditions could help reduce the costs associated with poor drug adherence, currently estimated at $100-$289 billion annually in the United States.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-67-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-67">67</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Greater use of open data can also help control fraud—a major drain on health budgets, estimated at around £3.35 billion annually in the United Kingdom, and some $80-$98 billion in the United States.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-68-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-68">68</a></span> For example, regulators and public watchdogs could combine demographic data and claim information for given regions to find cases of over-billing or fraudulent billing. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) use public records and a variety of other data to assign risk scores to patients and providers, thereby allowing the CMS to better target its compliance resources.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-69-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-69">69</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Efficiency is a complicated (and sometimes loaded) concept in the context of healthcare. A narrow focus on economic efficiency can in fact be deleterious to patient welfare. More than fifty years after the publication of Kenneth Arrow’s seminal essay on health economics, “Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care,” markets and healthcare continue to co-exist uneasily.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-70-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-70">70</a> </span>Nonetheless, there is reason to think that better and more public data can help reduce some of the inefficiencies inherent in healthcare markets—and, importantly, do so without harming patient interests. </p>

      <p class="ok_h2">II.1.4. Outcomes:</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Proposition:</span> Publishing data on general outcomes across the NHS system drives competition between healthcare professionals, which can in turn spur quality improvements and innovation. &#160;Opening health data to analysts and researchers improves both the quality and consistency of evaluation. </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Evidence from the Literature: </span>Perhaps one of the most significant value propositions for open data is its potential to positively affect the mission that is in many ways at the heart of any healthcare system: improved patient outcomes. Early evidence linking open data with improved outcomes was somewhat mixed. Today, however, there exists considerable evidence suggesting that increased data transparency can lead to improved outcomes. For instance, several studies have found reduced mortality rates following the implementation of the New York State Cardiac Surgery Reporting System mentioned earlier (“Accountability”).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-74-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-74">74</a> </span>The NHS has also found that publishing comparable data on clinical outcomes, which it began some nine years ago, has reduced the number of deaths in heart surgeries by up to 1,000 annually.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-75-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-75">75</a></span><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1"> </span>Similar results have been seen in Germany and Sweden, where public reporting of health data has significantly improved a variety of health outcomes, including recovery following aortic aneurysm repair, and cardiology-related ailments.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-76-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-76">76</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open data can also improve outcomes by playing a role in preventive healthcare. The rise of the “quantified self” movement allows individuals to compare their health status with demographic information contained in public databases. Applications like 100plus.com, for instance, benchmark individual data against public records maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data can also be used to avoid adverse drug reactions by matching patient profiles to patterns of adverse reactions contained in public data sets. Conversely, public databases can be used to match patients, based on demographic or other features, to treatments that are likely to be effective. In another example, suggestive of the range of possibilities for data in preventive healthcare, the Veterans Health Administration in the United States uses data (including public registers of deaths) to monitor and prevent suicides among veterans.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-77-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-77">77</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Taxonomy: </span>Though it is beneficial to think of outcomes primarily in terms of the health outcomes prioritized by the NHS, there are a number of other types of outcomes that can be identified. </p>

Based on their findings, Kaiser embedded a prompt within their electronic medical record system, Health Connect, to alert doctors at the point of care as to which ischemic stroke patients should receive statins. This is an example of how data can influence the so-called “choice architecture” of statin prescriptions and use to improve overall outcomes among stroke patients.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-78-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-78">78</a></span> </p>

By comingling the open data taken over long periods of time, or by aggregating anonymized data across multiple patients, a picture emerges of hot spots – times and places where breathing is difficult-- that can help other patients improve their condition.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-79-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-79">79</a></span></p>

By using the comparative data, there have been 1,000 fewer deaths in heart surgery units each year.

      <p class="ok_text">Measuring patient satisfaction is not straightforward. Self-reported satisfaction surveys can be unreliable, biased by unrealistic patient expectations. Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that better use of data (and information technology more generally) can help address common patient complaints such as waiting times or impersonal service. In a report on “the wait list problem,” for instance, the British Columbia Medical Association found an important role played by public awareness and patient access to information about waiting times.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-83-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-83">83</a> </span>In Ontario, a new programme uses clinical data on waiting periods for cancer patients to help doctors adjust staffing patterns and better serve patient needs.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-84-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-84">84</a></span> Electronic health records that make use of data and cutting edge technology can also help: one study by the Arizona State University found that patient waiting times in emergency rooms were reduced by 22 percent at hospitals that deployed such EHRs.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-85-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-85">85</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Using data to improve customer service is still in an exploratory phase. A range of innovations are being deployed across healthcare systems.

      <p class="ok_text">The link between open data and growth runs through many pathways. One of the most important is the opportunity offered by open data to entrepreneurs and innovators.

Importantly, the potential for innovation is not restricted to existing players. In recent years, a changing healthcare data landscape has led to the creation of entirely new industries and new types of companies. Data mining operations, automated imaging and image analysis businesses, a plethora of new consumer websites and mobile apps: these are just some of the entities emerging in the new ecosystem. Tim Kelsey, the National Director for Patients and Information at the NHS, has emphasized that open data comes first, and innovation will follow. “Our job is to simply make the data available,” he said at the Strata Conference in London 2013. “The benefit comes only when [entrepreneurs] become properly engaged and start turning that data into accessible tools and services.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-96-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-96">96</a> </span></p>

GenieMD was voted as the winning app. It provides users with a variety of patient services, including symptom checking, provider and pharmacy search, and generating alerts through an intuitive interface.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-101-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-101">101</a></span></p>

      <p class="ok_h1">II.2 Potential Challenges and Barriers of Open Data</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The preceding discussion makes evident the opportunities offered by open data. Along with the opportunities, however, come certain risks. Open data is in many ways a “disruptive” phenomenon.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-103-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-103">103</a> </span>Like all disruptive technologies, its implementation is likely to throw up several challenges and obstacles. This section discuss four obstacles to the implementation of open data in a healthcare setting:</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><img class="_idGenPageitem-6" src="image/38704.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">The list is not exhaustive. Moreover, because the field of open data is rapidly evolving, a moving target, the list is likely to change over time. Nonetheless, this section represents a preliminary attempt to consider some of the key challenges that are likely to affect the potential of open data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-104-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-104">104</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">II.2.1. Cultural and Institutional Barriers</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Institutional, bureaucratic and cultural resistance pose a significant challenge to data transparency. A recent study of barriers to open data conducted in the Netherlands placed “closed government culture” at the top of a ten-item list.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-105-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-105">105</a> </span>Such resistance can stem from vested interests (e.g., fear of losing authority, or of being exposed) or simply from an inherent fear of the unknown. In either case, achieving the potential of open data, in healthcare as well as other sectors, often requires what <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">The Guardian</span> calls “cultural change in the public sector.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-106-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-106">106</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Not all resistance is bureaucratic in nature, nor is it limited to the public sector. Resistance to open data can be more subtle, stemming from engrained habits, or personal judgments and biases established over decades. Patients, providers, and administrators must all adapt to a new way of collecting and using data; as a recent McKinsey report puts it, “this is a personal revolution as much as an analytical one.” The report cites the example of doctors who may be reluctant to replace or augment their clinical judgment, built over years of experience, with data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-107-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-107">107</a></span><span class="Char2Override-52">,</span><span class="Char2Override-24"><a id="footnote-29809-108-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-108">108</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">It is also worth emphasizing that resistance is not limited to the adoption of open data, or indeed to technology. In a 1998 <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">BMJ</span> paper on “Change and Resistance to Change in the NHS,” Diane Plamping wrote about a history of opposition to newness, and the difficulty of altering behavior in complex organizations.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-109-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-109">109</a></span> In this sense, the challenges confronting open data within organizations like the NHS are part of the more general challenge of “change management.” The literature on this topic is vast, but emphasizes collaboration, clear explanation of the benefits, and sincere efforts to address the concerns of those most affected by change.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-110-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-110">110</a> </span>In addition, in the context of open data, creating an ecosystem (including technical documentation, APIs, and applications) that clearly demonstrates the benefits and viability of data transparency can be helpful in overcoming resistance.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-111-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-111">111</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Relevant Legislation</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The legislative landscape for open health data should be seen both in light of laws governing the confidentiality and treatment of medical health records, and the legal framework of open data itself. Medical data in the United Kingdom is governed by four legislative acts:<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-112-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-112">112</a></span> (1) Public Records 1958; (2) Data Protection Act 1998; (3) Access to Medical Reports Act 1988; and (4) Access to Health Records Act 1990. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open data should also consider laws governing the use of identifiable data in research, such as the Data Protection Act (1998) and the Caldicott Standards (1997) and is based on the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-113-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-113">113</a></span> Existing regulation concerns the use of personal data across a wide range of sectors, including patient and medical data. A fundamental principle of the Data Protection Act (1998) is to use the minimal amount of personal data necessary to satisfy a purpose, to ensure that individual service users cannot be identified from data used to support purposes other than primary or direct care.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-114-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-114">114</a></span> To satisfy the Data Protection Act, the NHS supports the anonymisation or de-identification of data in some cases, and the pseudonymization of data in others. When anonymized, identifiable information is obscured within the person’s records sufficiently so as to garner minimal risk. This is done through the removal of personal identifiers, the use of identifier ranges (such as using value ranges instead of age), and through the use of pseudonyms.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Since not all open health data concerns patient records (e.g., many NHS bodies also generate financial information), these legislative acts are not always relevant to the protection of NHS data. When these acts do not apply, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) should be viewed as the relevant legislative force. This legislation was amended in 2012 to encourage public sector organizations to increase the number of datasets they make available, in a re-usable format.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-115-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-115">115</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">II.2.2. Privacy</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Sometimes two core societal values can come into tension. Even as governments increase their commitment to data transparency, there is concern that privacy could be threatened. On the one hand, there is little doubt that existing privacy legislation can sometimes represent a barrier to open data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-116-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-116">116</a></span> The Dutch study mentioned above cites privacy concerns and legislation as the second most important barrier to open data implementation (after cultural barriers).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-117-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-117">117</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">On the other hand, open data offers new challenges to privacy, pushing the barriers of existing protections and legislation in ways that must be addressed by organizations and authorities. Concerns over privacy include worries that personally identifiable (PII) data may be misused or inappropriately shared; that data made available in the name of the public interest may be used for unauthorized commercial purposes; and that data may be inaccurate or contain wrong information potentially harmful to individuals. Threats may exist even when data policies seem explicitly designed to protect privacy. For example, it has recently come to light that data held by the NHS may be accessed by other government agencies (including the police) through “backdoors,” even when patients have “opted out” of such sharing.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-118-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-118">118</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Efforts to de-personalize and anonymize data form an important part of any attempt to address privacy concerns. Yet anonymization represents only a partial response. It is now well established that even apparently anonymized data can be aggregated or otherwise manipulated so that it is de-anonymized and effectively tied to an individual. For example, researchers have conducted studies using crowdsourced metadata in the form of phone numbers, and found that, when combined with other free and public data sources such as Yelp, Google Places, and Facebook, it is possible to identify ostensibly anonymized individuals.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-119-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-119">119</a></span> Similar instances have been documented in a number of cases by researchers and real-life events, calling into question the usefulness of anonymization as a weapon against privacy.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-120-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-120">120</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">The difficulties of protecting privacy should not be taken as an argument against greater transparency. They do, however, call for a more measured approach to open data, one that takes into account the need for public trust and that builds privacy protections into the architecture of open data policies. For example, policies should include informed consent provisions (to whatever extent practical: it is not always possible to seek consent, nor are all individuals always fully informed).<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-121-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-121">121</a></span> In addition, to bolster the role of the individual in privacy-protection, data collection policies can integrate a more flexible opt-out clause, allowing users to revoke consent at any time.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-122-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-122">122</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">It must also be recognized that, although fully informed consent is not always possible, it is not desirable to return to a paternalistic model that takes away a patient’s ability or right to consent. Building oversight into the consent and data collection and use process is therefore an important part of ensuring privacy. This can be done through third-party audits and reviews of anonymization techniques, or by building greater awareness of privacy rights, for example in the design and wording of consent forms.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-123-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-123">123</a></span> Finally, any efforts to open data must be accompanied by strong disclosure and notification mechanisms to inform individuals and the public when data violations do occur. Such oversight is an essential part of ensuring accountability and discouraging practices that may lead to privacy or security breaches. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">Confronting Privacy Concerns in the NHS Open Data Programme </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Care.data, the UK’s plan to open up patient data, was postponed for six months after privacy concerns were raised by doctors and patient interest groups.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-124-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-124">124</a> </span>The postponement by NHS England was welcomed by critics and privacy experts who argued that most people did not understand the procedures under the new system, and that there would be little way for the public to determine who was using their medical records. <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">FaxYourGP.com</span>, an organization helping patients opt-out of data collection, has also postponed their campaigns until improvements are made to the Care.Data plan and released in May, 2014.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-125-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-125">125</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Other privacy concerns have emerged related to the purchasing of patient records, or semi-open data, by outside organizations and commercial companies.  In early March <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2013</span>, it was reported that a mapping website, Earthware, had released potentially identifiable personal data gained through the NHS.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-126-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-126">126</a> </span>Although the site was later found not to have breached any legal or regulatory rules, it nonetheless (and inadvertently) enabled users to locate areas in England where patients had gone for treatment, even in cases where only a single individual was recorded receiving specialized treatment. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Other privacy concerns emerged when it was found that patient data retrieved through the HSCIC had been uploaded to Google servers based outside the UK.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-127-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-127">127</a></span> The NHS Information Centre provided the data to PA Consulting, a technology innovation firm that then uploaded the data to Google and used a Google product called BigQuery to manipulate the datasets. The NHS IC was aware of these procedures, and had provided its written consent to share pseudonymized HES data with PA Consulting in November 2011.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-128-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-128">128</a></span> The NHS IC received written confirmation from PA Consulting prior to the agreement that no Google staff would be able to access the data, and access would only be granted by the individuals from PA Consulting named in the agreement.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-129-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-129">129</a></span> As with the previous example, this data was not open data but semi-open data – in other words, pseudonymized data available by request. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Semi-open data has a higher risk of compromising privacy than anonymized data. NHS officials insist that there is only a “small risk” that patients can be de-anonymized,<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-130-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-130">130</a></span> and that such pseudonymized data has been used for years, in a variety of settings. Nonetheless, because the same pseudonyms are used across different data sets and time, pseudonymized data does make it easier to identify individuals and poses a small but not negligible risk to privacy.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-131-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-131">131</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">II.2.3. Standards and Interoperability</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Many of the value propositions outlined for open data depend to a significant degree on “data liquidity”—the ability of data to flow easily among providers, patients and other groups involved in healthcare. Data liquidity has been described as occurring “when health [data] flows faster and more freely”; or when health IT can “bring ... information immediately to clinicians, patients, and others when and where they need it.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-132-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-132">132</a>  </span>When a complex, multi-leveled agency (such as the NHS, but this also applies to many other government agencies) decides to make data open, this does not necessarily mean that data becomes widely accessible. For one thing, much government data exists in what Bill Schrier, writing for the O’Reilly Labs, calls “ancient media” and “medieval databases”— non-digital, archived formats. <span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-133-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-133">133</a></span> Even when data is electronic, it often exists in proprietary formats, effectively trapped in information silos. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">It is therefore essential that the release of open data is accompanied by openness and transparency at the level of the technical standards that define that data. The more widespread a standard, and the more transparent its definition, the more the spirit of openness inherent in open data can actually be fulfilled. Every effort should be made to define data using standards like XML, and through the use of APIs that enhance accessibility. As a recent report commissioned by the UK Cabinet Office makes clear, the use of open standards doesn’t simply promote access and openness: it also prevents lock-in to proprietary IT systems, promotes innovation and competition, and can lower the overall cost of large IT projects.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-134-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-134">134</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">In addition to technical interoperability, there is a need to promote semantic interoperability through the establishment and enforcement of data standards across datasets. The NHS has established a set of data standards and a set of guidelines to ensure consistent data formats and coding systems for electronic records within the NHS.<span class="Char2Override-40"><a id="footnote-29809-135-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-135">135</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Finally, it is worth mentioning that interoperability itself can mean many things and has multiple levels in a healthcare setting. The box below (<span class="Char2Override-46">Box I</span>) describes three different types of interoperability, as included in a 2008 report by the UK Information Standards Board for Health and Social Care. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) Technical Interoperability:</span> “the ability of two or more systems to exchange data accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently such that the relationship between the data items is preserved between the sending and receiving system.”</p>
      <p class="ok_indent2"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">2) Semantic Interoperability:</span> “the ability to communicate and exchange information accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently between different information technology systems, software applications, and networks in various settings, and exchange data such that clinical or operational purpose, context and meaning of the information are preserved and unaltered. The system will be capable of utilising this information to provide simple and complex alerts and interface with decision support applications. “</p>
      <p class="ok_indent2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">3) Process Interoperability:</span> “the ability to communicate and exchange information accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently between different information technology systems, software applications, and networks in various settings, and exchange data such that clinical or operational purpose, context and meaning of the information are preserved and unaltered. The system will be capable of utilizing this information to provide simple and complex alerts and interface with decision support applications and in addition will be capable of filtering and summarising information and presenting this to the clinical team along with triggers that support work processes and care plans.”</p>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">II.2.4. Good Analysis</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">It may be true, as so much of the technical and business literature argues, that a decision is only as good as the underlying data. However, good data does not guarantee a good decision. Another way of saying this is that data does not exist or “act” in a vacuum: it is mediated through human judgments and subjectivity. Those judgments may be flawed; data can be misinterpreted and misunderstood, often due to personal biases or organizational or cultural pressures.  Arguably, such mistakes are more likely to occur in situations where large amounts of data are suddenly made available: a data glut, as much as data paucity, can pose severe analytical challenges.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-136-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-136">136</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open data can also be deliberately misinterpreted or misused. A recent report cites the (hypothetical) example of MRI providers who use open data to “target consumers for treatment based on their characteristics, rather than actual need.”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-137-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-137">137</a> </span>Similarly, open data can be used to target or market to patients from disadvantaged and less-informed demographics.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-138-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-138">138</a> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text _idGenParaOverride-1">A comprehensive data transparency policy will therefore embed its approach to open data within a human and social context. It will take account of ways data can be abused or misused. It will focus on developing not only technical capacity within an organization, but also human analytical capacity. As a recent <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Harvard Business Review</span> article entitled “Good Data Won’t Guarantee Good Decisions” puts it: “IT needs to spend more time on the ‘I’ and less on the ‘T.’”<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-139-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-139">139</a></span> Training, education, mentoring and general human capacity building are all part of this process, and essential components of any effort to increase data transparency.</p>
      <p class="ok_parts _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Char2Override-54">Part III</span><br />Towards <br />a Conceptual Framework <br />for Open Data <br />in Healthcare</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="Char2Override-46">Part I</span> and <span class="Char2Override-46">Part II</span> of this paper have highlighted some of the potential and challenges of open data in healthcare. In this section, we seek to develop a conceptual framework that will help to achieve that potential and limit those challenges. A conceptual framework can help to measure the impact of open data. It offers a model that will allow the NHS to become more <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">goal-oriented,</span> permitting it to set clear priorities for the use of open data and targets for change. In addition, a conceptual framework can help the NHS become more <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">agile</span>, allowing it to focus on continuous improvement by periodically measuring results, thereby providing the basis for adjustments (tactical and strategic) to keep open data projects on track. Our overall goal in this section is to develop a roadmap and research agenda for the implementation of open data policies and applications in a healthcare setting. </p>
      <p class="ok_h1">III.1.What is a conceptual framework and why do we need one?</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Although there is now widespread recognition of the possibilities offered by open data, we are still at the early stages of understanding how best to use it. This is true not just of open data in a healthcare setting, but also a wide range of other settings and governance contexts. Policymaking is often easier than policy implementation: it is one thing to say what <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">should</span> be done, and quite another to know <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">how</span> to do it.  In addition, even when we know how to implement a policy, it is often challenging to measure the impact of that policy.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-140-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-140">140</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">A large part of the problem—a problem we seek to address in this section--stems from the fact that we lack a conceptual vocabulary to describe open data interventions.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-141-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-141">141</a></span> As Francis Fukuyama, writing on the poor state of assessing governance worldwide, put it in a recent paper: “[W]e cannot measure what we cannot adequately conceptualize, we have to start with the concept first.<span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">” </span><span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-142-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-142">142</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">A conceptual framework can be understood as a theory of change, or a logic model, that helps us understand what specific interventions or actions are needed to achieve a desired outcome. It establishes metrics to measure, and a methodology to achieve, success. It does so by establishing the parameters and components of any intervention, allowing us to test assumptions, identify the relationships among resources available for an intervention, and establish the activities necessary to achieve a particular goal.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The logic model we have developed for the NHS is illustrated in Figure <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2</span>, and described more fully below. Its key components and the logical chain it establishes can be explained as follows:</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">The use of certain kinds of inputs and data (INPUTS: OPEN DATA), by certain kinds of users (USERS), for certain kinds of activities (ACTIVITIES), will achieve certain outputs (OUTPUTS) and outcomes (INDICATORS) that indicate impact (IMPACT). Specific methodologies (METHODOLOGIES) will be used to collect and measure indicators, helping to assess impact. </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><br /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">In developing this conceptual framework, we were guided by two overriding principles, each of which is central to a successful implementation of open data by the NHS: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Focus on results, determining impact and effectiveness. We want to allow for clear attribution of outcomes resulting from the use of open health data.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Architect metrics into design, embedding them from the outset for systematic use at each stage of the open data management cycle: planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-3"><img class="_idGenPageitem-9" src="image/41107.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">At the core of our conceptual framework lies the data that is accessed and used. This data (and more generally the set to which it belongs) will determine the extent and quality of openness, and by extension will set the boundaries of what can be achieved through greater transparency. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">As a reminder, we have suggested that there are several categories of open data within the NHS, and that data should be seen as existing on a spectrum of “openness.”  At one end of the spectrum, there is <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">open health data</span>, which can be accessed directly by anyone through data portals such as <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Data.gov.uk</span> and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) found at <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Hscic.gov.uk</span>. Such data is focused on financial and statistical data for individual NHS departments and hospitals, trusts, and CCGs, and is available in .CSV format. Open data provided through the HSCIC includes information such as prescription data, the number of patients registered at GP practices, and audits of chronic disease prevalence such as cancer and diabetes. Open data is all data published under the transparency agenda, and the Open Government License.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-143-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-143">143</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_text">We also described a category of data called <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">“semi-open”</span> data. For instance, certain forms of patient-centred data are offered through the NHS Choices website and other NHS sites, but is not provided in fully downloadable format. Semi-open health data is also frequently available to researchers and other organizations upon request, and upon receipt of a fee.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-144-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-144">144</a></span> The key difference between semi-open and fully open data is that the latter is available in full-downloadable format, whereas the former must be requested through <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">HSCIC.gov.uk.</span><span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-145-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-145">145</a></span><span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1"> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">For the purposes of the conceptual framework, we include both open and semi-open data. Although there are important differences in the ways and extent to which each form of data can be accessed and manipulated, we effectively consider both to be open data. However, there exist several other conditions and standards that determine what kinds of data can be included within our framework: </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) Formats</span>: In order to be considered open, data should be published in a standard format, without proprietary conditions, be machine readable, fully downloadable and available online.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">2) Legal: </span>Open health data should conform to the European Union Data Protection Directive 1998 (DPA), the Public Records Ac 1958 the Access to Health Records Act 1990, and the Access to Medical Reports Act 1988.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-146-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-146">146</a>, <a id="footnote-29809-147-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-147">147</a></span> Since not all open health data concerns medical records, such as financial records of NHS bodies, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 that created a public “right of access” to information held by public authorities is also relevant. These acts require the anonymization of most data, and, failing that, the setting of privacy safeguards for individuals, and the protection of identifiable data from disclosure to third parties. Records collected by the NHS will be anonymized by removing information such as names, and through a process of de-identification.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-148-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-148">148</a></span> Though patients must provide consent to the collection of their data under the acts, they can also choose to “opt-out” of data collection at a later point,<span class="OK_sup Char2Override-57"> </span>further increasing their opportunities to protect their privacy.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-149-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-149">149</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">3) Financial: </span>Some of the data included in our framework may be made available for a nominal fee (i.e., semi-open health data). Organizations such as university research departments, insurers and drug companies will be able to apply to gain access to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) databases.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-150-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-150">150</a></span> These are primarily datasets that are not included under the open government license, and that may include de-identified or personalized information. The type of data depends on purpose and need, and who is requesting it. </p>
      <p class="ok_h2">Typology</p>
      <p class="ok_text">A number of different types of open and semi-open data are held and made available by the NHS. Different types of data will determine what kinds of activities and outcomes are possible. Therefore, when assessing the impact of open data, researchers should pay close attention to the type of data under consideration. Broadly, two different typologies can be identified:</p>
      <p class="ok_h3"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">TYPOLOGY 1: Internal Data</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Following a survey of the open data available at the time of our analysis (on Data.gov.uk, HSCIC, NHS Choices, and the regional and local sites), we developed the following typology of “internal” data. Such data is less likely to be accessed by patients than by researchers, agencies, watchdog organizations or groups seeking to assess or audit the performance of the NHS. In this typology, we can include the following forms of data: </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">1) Financial Data: </span>Financial data on NHS departments, regional trusts and CCGs, much of which can be found on <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Data.gov.uk</span>. This data normally includes information on costs and spending, and is held in .CSV format. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2) Administrative Data: </span>Administrative data is available on NHS departments through <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Data.gov.uk</span>, and is available in .CSV format.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">3) Statistical/Diagnostic Data: </span>The NHS frequently publishes statistics on chronic disease rates, preventable infections, and a wide range of other topics. Open health data, for instance, held in HSCIC.gov.uk’s archives (NHS Information Centre) includes statistics on a variety of issues including data quality, hospital care, illnesses and conditions, mental health, patient experience, prescribing, primary care services, public health, social care, workforce data. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">4) Audits: </span>The majority of data published under the Open Government License takes the form of audits on NHS departments and special divisions. In a transparency and open data letter to the Cabinet Ministers in July of 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron committed to making audit data available through the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-151-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-151">151</a></span> These audits engage healthcare professionals across England and Wales in the systematic evaluation of their clinical practice standards, to support improvement in the quality of treatment and care.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-152-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-152">152</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_h3"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">TYPOLOGY 2: STREAMS OF HEALTH DATA</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open health data includes information about a wide-range of players within the NHS system. Therefore, certain types of open health data are more focused on some groups than others. For example, audits place an emphasis on the quality of treatment and care provided by healthcare practitioners to their patients in cases of chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. To understand the impact of open health data, it is important to know the target of the data set that is being opened up by the NHS. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="Char2Override-46">Open Health Data on Practitioners</span>: Examples include doctors, administrators, midwives, nurses, etc.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="Char2Override-46">Open Health Data on the System/Infrastructure:</span> Examples include hospitals, clinics, equipment, and waiting times, etc.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="Char2Override-46">Open Health Data on Patients:</span><span class="Char2Override-47"> Examples</span><span class="Char2Override-46"> </span><span class="Char2Override-47">include diagnoses, prescribing rates, mortality rates, treatment options, etc. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h1">III.3. Users: Who is using the data? <br />What is their relationship to the NHS? </p>
      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-3"><img class="_idGenPageitem-9" src="image/38320.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">When assessing the impact of open data initiatives, researchers should identify both the user (or category of user, such as an organization), and its relationship to the NHS. Different users of data may have different criteria for determining the success of an activity or programme. In addition, different users – whether they are internal or external - may value some outputs over others, or may be solely interested in the impact or outcome of an open data initiative on their particular interest or sector. For this reason, it is also important that users themselves identify their particular areas of interest, and help determine their own set of indicators upon which to judge success. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">This report separates users into two broad categories, depending on their relationship to the NHS system:<span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1"> </span></p>
      <p class="ok_h3"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">(1)</span> <span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">Internal Users</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Internal users are those who work within the health system, including healthcare providers, such as physicians, nurses, administrators, and other healthcare professionals, health funds (Trusts/CCGs), and other government agencies, such as the UK Department of Health and Ministry of Finance. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">(2) External Users</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">External users are those who interact with open data from a position that is partly or completely external to the NHS. This includes patients and members of the public, external supervisory and regulatory agencies (such as the Royal Society for Public Health), watchdog organizations such as media and citizen interest groups, businesses and commercial interest groups, academic researchers, and policy scholars.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-153-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-153">153</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_h1">III.4. Activities: How is data used? </p>
      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-3"><img class="_idGenPageitem-10" src="image/38358.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Ultimately, how and for what purposes data is used will determine the impact of an open data initiative. As illustrated by the logic model, users use open data and semi-open data, possibly in conjunction with or independently of privately held data, and this use leads to specific outputs or results. Each unique activity (use) leads to its own measurable output indicator. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open data will be used for different purposes, depending on the position and intention of the user accessing the information. For instance,  internal and external users might use the same data set for a different set of activities. An internal user (such as a NHS administrator or executive) could use open data for the purposes of benchmarking, hotspotting, or to compare performance against a standard in order to improve the quality of care. A user external to the NHS (such as a watchdog organization) could use the same data to compare actual health outcomes against the standards proposed by the NHS or the government. The primary uses of open data will be used to improve management practices within the NHS, as well as to improve policies geared towards public services. Though the activity may appear similar, the impact of the use is likely to be different. As open data is collected on an ongoing basis, the same dataset can be used to address a variety of problems, dependent on the needs of the researcher or organization. The internal user intends to improve efficiency within the NHS; the external user seeks to increase accountability. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">A number of other possible uses for data exist. A more complete list can be found in Appendix VI. For our discussion here, the important point is that researchers seeking to understand the effectiveness of an open data initiative should always consider the use (or activity) for which data is accessed. Understanding use can help determine impact, and ultimately will guide our assessment of the success or failure of an initiative.</p>
      <p class="ok_h1">III.5. Outputs: What was the value produced by the open data initiative (activity)? </p>
      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-3"><img class="_idGenPageitem-10" src="image/38377.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Outputs are basic metrics of success in quantitative terms, such as the number of additional patients served, or the number of pounds saved. Outputs themselves are basic indicators of a sort, though they are tied very closely with the activity, or open data initiative. More high-level indicators are also needed to measure how well an initiative achieves the long-term goals of the NHS.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">There are a number of examples of potential outputs. Referring to the example given in the <span class="Char2Override-46">Activities</span> section (<span class="Char2Override-46">III.4</span>), an output for an external user engaging in benchmarking might be the difference between a desired outcome and a measurement of the actual outcome. For instance, an administrator using open data to assess the rate of preventable in-hospital disease would consider the output to be the difference between the  expected rate of preventable disease and the actual reported result. More examples of outputs are listed in the <span class="Char2Override-46">Appendix VII</span>. </p>
      <p class="ok_h1">III.6. Indicators: To what end? </p>
      <p class="ok_note"><span class="Char2Override-59"><img class="_idGenPageitem-10" src="image/38392.png" alt="" /></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">The selection of indicators and metrics is a value-based assessment based on the desired outcomes of the NHS. A metric can be thought of as a numerical unit of measurement, such as number or percent of increase or decrease, while an indicator is a metric that is tied to one or more targets, such as an outcome like rates of premature mortality. Open data initiatives target both the impact of open health data on metrics and indicators, as well as the role of open data in supporting the values and guidelines outlined here for the use of open data. To this end, measures and indicators are assessed with an eye towards how open data can help the NHS achieve the values of <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">accountability</span>, <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">efficiency</span>, <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">choices, outcomes, customer service,</span> and <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">innovation and economic growth</span>. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Indicators build on outputs<span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">,</span> or basic measures of success for any given activity undertaken through the use of open health data. They are generally short-term indicators that can determine whether an activity led to a desired result. More high-level indicators make use of these outputs to determine whether the activities led to any long-term changes within the NHS system. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">An indicator is therefore the result of an output. For instance, an indicator can be a decrease in premature patient mortality, a decrease in the average hospital stay, or a decrease in hospital spending (the output would be the absolute number or percentage pertaining to mortality, hospital stays, and spending). Indicators are essential for researchers seeking to assess the impact of open health data—they provide information on success or failure, and help us understand the extent to which any programme has achieved its stated goals. More examples of indicators can be found in<span class="Char2Override-46"> Appendix VIII</span>.</p>
      <p class="ok_h1">III.7. Methodologies to Measure Impact: According to what measure? </p>
      <p class="ok_text ParaOverride-3"><img class="_idGenPageitem-11" src="image/38408.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Once indicators have been established, data can be collected using a number of different methodologies. These include, for instance, direct observation, questionnaires, document review, focus groups, interviews, and an analysis of administrative data. Ultimately the method used will depend on the specific programme, and on the desired outcome. </p>
      <p class="ok_h2">Three categories of measurement:</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Traditionally, there are three broad categories of research design to evaluate societal intervention programmes:</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) </span><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-34">Experimental designs</span><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">: </span>Researchers randomly assign one group of people to be participants and another group to be non-participants, and compare results between the two groups to establish the effect of the programme. Experimental designs are commonly referred to as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and are considered the most rigorous research methodology. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent">There<span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21"> </span>are many examples of potential experimental designs. For example, researchers might be interested in finding out whether an awareness of hospital waiting times affects whether or not patients visit a hospital in their locality. After obtaining a list of people who wished to take part in the programme, they could randomly assign the participants to two groups. The experimental group would differ from the control group <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">only</span> in that they had access to information about hospital wait times. Researchers would then observe whether the two groups differed in their visits to local hospitals, and the results would provide an indication about the impact and potential usefulness of releasing data about hospital wait times. Similar experiments can be designed for a range of other situations, all designed to measure differences in behavior, impact or outcomes as a result of access to open data.  </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"> 2) <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">Quasi-experimental </span>designs may use groups of “participants” who have not officially signed up for an experiment or programme, or may consider a single group, measuring the effects before and after that group has access to data. Quasi-experimental designs may also differ from experimental designs in that participants in the programme and comparison group are <span class="OK_italic Char2Override-21">not</span> randomly assigned; rather, a comparison group may be selected after a programme group has been established. This technique is less rigorous because there is no certainty that the two groups are comparable across all characteristics. For example, those who choose to sign up for a waiting times application may be more technologically savvy, and may have other obligations, such as inflexible work schedules or childcare, that would at least partially determine their actions within the programme.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent">3) <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Non-experimental</span> techniques, considered the least rigorous method for measuring programme success, may involve a single survey delivered after a programme, in order to gain descriptive information.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-154-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-154">154</a></span>  Non-experimental techniques are less effective in establishing causality. For example, researchers using a design survey evaluating the effectiveness of open data internally within the NHS will not be able to conclusively determine whether an increased efficiency resulted from the open data, or from other organizational practices.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-21"><span class="Char2Override-60">MIXED METHODS APPROACH</span></p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-21">To study the impact of open data, it may be best to employ a combination of the three approaches described above. Frequently used in the social sciences, this combination is referred to as a <span class="Char2Override-34">mixed methods </span>approach, a mix of qualitative and quantitative resarch design.<span class="Char2Override-40"><a id="footnote-29809-155-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-155">155</a></span> This approach can be taken when there are a number of data streams available, each with their own limitations. In the case of open data, a quantiative variable could be data download rates. When combined with qualitative data, such as a user survey held on the site with the relevant dataset, researchers seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular dataset can learn more from users about the purpose of use for the data, the effectiveness of the presentation of data, and other information dependent upon the research questions being posed. Given that most research studying the impact of open data will be conducted in a complex social environment, rather than an enclosed controlled setting, a mixed method approach can be used to increase both the validity and reliability of the data being collected.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-21">There are four major types of mixed methods design: </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) Triangulation: </span>Merging qualitative and quantiative methods, such as in the example provided above.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2) Embedded: </span>Using either quantitative or qualitative methods to answer a research question within a largely quantiative or qualitative study. For instance, this can include the use of interview techniques to make sense of a portion of quantitative data, to gain a deeper understanding of quantitative indicator that was being measured. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">3) Explanatory: </span>Using qualitative data to help explain or elaborate upon quantitative results.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">4) Exploratory: </span>Using quantiative data to test or to explain a relationship that has been found through qualitative methods.</p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Possible Tools: </span>A variety of tools exist to conduct all three forms of research-- experimental, quasi-experimental, and non-experimental that can be used in a mixed methods approach. A non-exhaustive list includes the following: </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">A) Data Collection Methodologies:</span></p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-22"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) Surveys/Questionnaires:</span><span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1"> </span>Both a quantiative and a qualitative measure that<span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1"> </span>can be used to determine outcomes such as patient satisfaction, use of data to determine treatment options, and choice in services. They can include both close-ended questions or open-ended questions that can be transformed into quantiative data. Surveys can also be used to assess the effectiveness of an open data programme at the level of healthcare administrators and professionals. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-22"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2) Site Analytics and Download Rates</span>: Quantitative measures that can be used to determine the effectiveness of open data. Part of the impact of open data can be determined solely through the number and types of individuals who access it.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-22"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">3) Other Numerical Data</span>: Insight can be gained from budgetary information from before or after the introduction of an open data programme, or other performance measures such as items produced, patients seen, wait times, prescribing rates, diagnoses, and other relevant measures.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-22"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">4) Content Analysis: </span>Researchers examining the impact of open health data through the frequency of citations should score the reports, applications, and entrepreneurial activities in relation to the six Open Data value propositions outlined above (Part II). The more mentions of accountability, efficiency, choices, outcomes, customer service/patient satisfaction, and innovation/economic growth, the higher the score. Special attention should be paid to evidence suggesting that open data had real-world impact and was used to achieve one of these value propositions. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent2 ParaOverride-23"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">a) Number of media and academic mentions of open data</span>:<span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21"> </span>The impact of open data can be partially determined by the extent to which it is used or referred to in academic and media reports.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-156-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-156">156</a></span> </p>
      <p class="ok_indent2 ParaOverride-23"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">b) Number of Open Data Sets Mentioned in Grant Applications and Policy Proposals: </span>The impact of open health data can also be seen in the number of citations in grant applications and policy proposals, especially those that could lead to change in government transparency and accountability, social equality, healthcare reform, and other similar initiatives.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent2 ParaOverride-23"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">c) Number of Open Data Sets Used in Entrepreneurial and Business Activities</span>: In addition, the impact of open data can be assessed through its usage in the development of new products, services, and applications. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">B) Qualitative Methodologies:</span></p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-24"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) Interviews: </span> Can be either structured or semi-structured (or a combination of the two), and can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the view of the participants of an open data programme, or users of open data. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-24"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2) Observation/Focus Groups: </span>To evaluate the effectiveness of open data programmes, it may be useful for researchers to enter into departments or organizations using open data to observe participants in their use of open data, to evaluate its use and effectiveness in context.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-24">3)<span class="Char2Override-47"> </span><span class="Char2Override-46">Interpretive Methods:</span> There are a variety of  interpretive methods that can be used by researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of open data. Included within this (but not limited to) are critical studies, legal interpretive analysis, historical analysis, and policy analysis.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">B) Other Methodologies:  </span></p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-24"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">1) Design Science: </span> A method normally employed in engineering and computer science, design science is increasingly being integrated into information systems research. Researchers use the act of design (such as a web application) as an opportunity for theory-testing and building.<span class="Char2Override-40"><a id="footnote-29809-157-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-157">157</a></span> Researchers identify a problem, define their objectives for a solution, design a product or program to address the problem and lead to the solution, and then evaluate the program in use, noting the observed results from those that were intended. This method should be used in conjunction with many of the data collection or qualitative methods described above. </p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-24"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">2) Computational Social Science: </span> A burgeoning interdisciplinary field that studies complex social systems through computational modeling and related techniques.<span class="Char2Override-40"><a id="footnote-29809-158-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-158">158</a></span> Computational approaches can include (but are not limited to) social network analysis, social geospatial modelling (GIS) methods, and automated content analysis. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">It should be stated that open data is itself changing the way research is conducted, leading to new methodologies and new forms and sources of data.  Traditionally, social sciences research has relied on data that is collected one time, which is often self-reported by research participants through the use of surveys and interviews.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-159-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-159">159</a></span> Data has expanded opportunities for both quantitative and qualitative data in the social sciences, offering access to content-related information such as anonymized emails, public forums, and search records, as well as quantitative information that can enable social scientists to analyze macro trends. In addition, greater use of data and new technologies increases the potential for data collected over a period of time, possibly as the result of a series of interactions with the researcher, thus making it easier to make comparisons across weeks and months and even years. In these ways and many others, open data is pushing at the boundaries of research methodologies; this process has just begun, and is likely to lead to many new and innovative methodologies.</p>
      <p class="ok_indent ParaOverride-21"><span class="Char2Override-61">Recommendations for Building Metrics-into-Design</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">To increase the ease and effectiveness of research programmes studying the impact of open data, it may be useful to consider what metrics or incentives can be built into the design of sites housing open data. In light of the tools listed above, the following recommendations can be made:</p>

      <p class="ok_h2">Can randomized controlled trials (RCTs) be used to evaluate policy?</p>
      <p class="ok_text">A recent report published by the UK Cabinet Office’s Behavioural Insights Team  advocates for using an old methodology to reinvigorate the testing of public policy interventions.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-160-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-160">160</a></span> Long established as a tool in science and medicine, the authors of the report argue that randomized control trials (RCTs) should also be used to test the effectiveness of policies implemented in the UK.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">According to the report, new policy interventions should be evaluated using evidence from RCTs to determine whether or how a policy or intervention is working within a community. The RCTs would compare the intervention with control groups that were not exposed to the same condition, using this comparison to eliminate potential bias or confounding variables that could influence policy effectiveness (such as general economic conditions at the time of implementation).</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Using RCTs in policy programmes enables researchers to develop counterfactual conditions, comparing old and new policies, and gaining insight into what might occur if policy interventions are implemented. These conditions will help to determine the cost effectiveness of intervention programmes, and to assure citizens that public money is being spent on policies that have been proven to deliver value for the cost.</p>

      <p class="ok_parts"><span class="Char2Override-39">Part IV</span> <br />Building an Open Data Learning Environment (ODLE)</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The preceding discussion has outlined the key value propositions for the implementation of open data as well as a conceptual framework that can help achieve (and measure) those value propositions. For the moment, the conceptual framework remains just that—a concept or theory. Future research and variations on this paper can help bridge the gap between theory and practice, and build on the conceptual framework to develop a series of specific recommendations and real-world activities that can help the NHS achieve its goals.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">As a starting point towards this effort, we offer one specific recommendation in this section. We suggest that the NHS create an Open Data Learning Environment (ODLE), both to explore and develop potential applications of open health data, and to assess how effectively it is currently being used. As much as the NHS might intend or desire to open all its data, there do of course exist practical constraints. An ODLE can help prioritize which data to make open, and in what way. It serves as a foundation for future open data initiatives, guiding the NHS in its ongoing efforts to achieve greater transparency and the six value propositions outlined in this paper. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">In what follows we propose ten steps that can help in building such a learning environment. A variety of ways exist for each of these steps to be implemented; here, we outline a few pathways towards implementation. </p>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">1) </span><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">Build an Open Data Learning Capacity and Culture</span> within the NHS. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">To create a deeper understanding of the current and potential uses of open data, the NHS will need a commitment from leadership to institutionalize action and learning across its various open data projects and initiatives. Such a broad, comparative view will make it easier to determine what works and what doesn’t, and to use cross-programme insights to build a more effective institutional strategy. Importantly, each individual programme should be designed with this broader view in mind. Mechanisms to learn from individual programmes should be architected into the design of those programmes. Measuring impact should not be an afterthought; it must be considered up front at the design stage of every project. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop an NHS Open Data “Do and Learn Tank.” Unlike a traditional think tank, this would be structured to help launch new projects using lessons from existing programmes and initiatives and evaluate their results.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Set up an NHS Data Geek Squad to create a corps of volunteer data geeks and researchers from Britain’s best universities to work with open health data. This could be modeled on Datakind in the U.S., or on Code for America (although Code for America focuses its work city by city rather than by datasets).</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Connect research organizations already existing within the NHS, such as the NIHR.ac.uk, that are already examining the impact of open data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-161-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-161">161</a></span></li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Use prizes to stimulate new solutions to public problems using open health data, as the UK and U.S. governments have already begun doing.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop campaigns designed to promote data sharing, and raise awareness about the release of open datasets, their locations online, and their potential uses by the public. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul"> Set up an open health data academy that trains people to use open health data and measure its impact, using online learning, project-focused instruction, and mentoring.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Fund the creation of NHS open health data fellowships for students and graduates with compelling ideas and practical ways to implement them.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop an open health data mentor network to encourage and train new recruits and younger members of the NHS in the use of open data. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">2) Engage the public in defining metrics</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Engage the public in defining metrics</span> of success with regard to open data. The public also has valuable insights and lessons to contribute to this proposed ODLE. In addition, since all indicators and uses of data are inextricably linked with priorities and values—i.e., we measure what we care about--open data policies should reflect a larger social and political perspective. The NHS should therefore ensure that direct stakeholders (e.g., patients and providers) are included in decisions about open data and how it is used. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop a citizens’ open health data panel (similar to Hackney’s online citizen panel) to review metrics on a regular basis.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Facilitate  user-led design exercises to better understand how open data can support stakeholders’ work and ultimately improve people’s lives.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Design and implement online mechanisms such as ratings and feedback tools to gauge public opinion and solicit insights from citizens.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Create a “Metrics Bank” of important indicators, with input from stakeholders, researchers, and experts in the field who have studied the relevant literature.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Prioritize the creation of an inventory of datasets by departments within the NHS, and invite experts to curate the datasets released to the public.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">3) Stay focused on what really matters</span>. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Too often, indicators used to measure open data only quantify the level of use (e.g., the number of datasets used or money saved). The metrics that really matter, however, are those that are focused on improving people’s health and lives. The NHS must not lose sight of these truly important metrics. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop NHS Open Data Stories that will allow stakeholders to share how open data improved people’s lives in real time.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Use surveys, social media, and sentiment analysis to learn what dimensions of healthcare improvement are most important to the public, and ensure that success metrics and indicators capture those priorities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">4) Develop a common assessment framework</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-21">Develop a common assessment framework</span> with partners in other sectors and other countries.  As the NHS is developing a research agenda to measure the impact of open data, it is important to coordinate with other organizations, sectors and countries that are also designing analytical frameworks for the use of open data across sectors. This coordination is an essential part of developing an ODLE. Among other things, it will require participants to agree on definitions of key terms in the sector; make assessment methods comparable and context sensitive; assess and compare outputs, outcomes and impacts; and above all, limit duplication and pool efforts to reduce costs and generally enhance efficiency.</p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Set up an annual meeting/listserv/monthly hangouts on open health data research to trade best practices and ideas.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Create a directory (perhaps in wiki format) of other assessment frameworks across countries and sectors. Such a directory would also include a list of key contacts and organizations.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Use online and offline meet-ups and other approaches to create  a culture that encourages knowledge sharing and collaboration with other organizations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">5) Stay flexible and adaptive in measuring impact</span>. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">As the use of open data evolves and becomes more dispersed, the NHS will need to find a balance between a centralized measurement function (which sets measurement standards, aggregates data across programmes, and monitors data quality) and a more diffused structure that empowers users at different levels of the organization. Recent studies have shown that a mix of methodologies—e.g., quantitative, qualitative, randomized control trials, and other methods--is needed to evaluate new programmes that provide public goods. Ultimately, we must adopt an approach that does not rely on a single method but that selects the best of various methods.</p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Hold regular “What Works Camps” that connect various users and researchers. </li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Ensure that all metrics (especially those to measure use and impact) are categorized by different levels and can be analyzed separately.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Continue ongoing research into new and existing approaches to impact measurement. This research effort should be considered a core part of the NHS open data programme.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">6) Share what is learned (including failures) with everyone</span>.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">The best way to learn and improve is from the NHS’ own efforts to work with open data.  Failures and mistakes are in this regard as important as successes. By sharing what is learned on a regular basis, the NHS can ultimately enhance the way open data is used. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop visualizations of how open data has made an impact--for example, through maps that show changes in healthcare quality, efficiency, or cost in different geographical areas.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop an Open Health Data 10 – a listing of the ten most impactful uses of open health data.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Consider wikis, seminars and other means for stakeholders within the NHS to share stories and experiences with open data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">7) Build a research network and expert network</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Build a research network and expert network</span> to build capacity quickly and broker debate around methodology and findings. Understanding the best knowledge and thinking in the field will be key in all stages of the research cycle to assess the impact of NHS open data.</p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Hold an annual summit to exchange what has been learned, along with regular meet-ups.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Set up an NHS Open Data listserv.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Consider establishing an external advisory or consulting board of experts to whom the NHS can turn for advice and guidance. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-4">8) Develop open health data ecology map</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Develop open health data ecology map</span> , including a dictionary of all open health data sets in the NHS along with the variety of uses and users. This map should include visualizations and other graphical representations to fully represent how open data is being accessed and used within the NHS.</p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop a conceptual map of users, uses and impact.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop a site inventorying all available datasets within the NHS, making it easy for users to access datasets from a variety of online spaces and departments.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop a crowdsourced resource of innovative start-ups and new applications that use open health data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_h2"><span class="OK_Strong Char2Override-56">9) Publish, integrate and fine-tune the open data conceptual framework</span></p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Publish, integrate and fine-tune the open data conceptual framework</span> for feedback and improvement. The conceptual framework presented in this report is an attempt to guide the systematic review and study of the open data value chain. A framework, as we have noted, represents just a concept or theory. In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice, it is essential that various stakeholders participate in refining the framework. The framework must itself be responsive and flexible; its design must constantly be refined and implemented using the same level of transparency as embodied by the concept of open data.</p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul">Develop an interactive version of the conceptual framework that can be annotated.</li>

      <p class="ok_text">While the NHS’ release of open health data will benefit both public and private-sector entities, those benefits can be enhanced if the beneficiary entities can help participate in shaping the government’s open data programme. The NHS should engage key stakeholders on a regular basis to determine which datasets have the highest priority for them; what new datasets should be released as open data; and which open data collections are particularly easy or difficult to use. </p>
      <p class="ok_h3">Possible Pathways: </p>

      </ul>
      <p class="ok_parts"><span class="Char2Override-64">Part V</span><br />Conclusion</p>
      <p class="ok_text">As the NHS continues its ambitious plans to release unprecedented amounts of data, it is clear that open data can have a powerful, transformative effect on how healthcare is delivered and consumed. This paper has outlined six key Value Propositions for data transparency and openness in a healthcare setting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Accountability:</span> Using data to hold healthcare organizations and providers accountable for treatment outcomes.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Choice:</span> Providing open data to help patients make informed choices from among the healthcare options available to them.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Efficiency:</span> Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Outcomes:</span> Improving treatment outcomes by using open data to make the results of different treatments, healthcare organizations, and providers’ work more transparent.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Customer service:</span> Using open data to educate patients and their families and make healthcare institutions more responsive.</li>
        <li class="ok_ul"><span class="OK_Strong _idGenChar2Override-1">Economic growth and innovation:</span> Using open data to fuel new healthcare companies and initiatives and to spur innovation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ok_text">As leaders in the open data movement, the NHS and more generally the United Kingdom are well-positioned to reap the benefits of these Value Propositions. These benefits can have powerful ripple effects on the broader economy. Yet as we have also argued, there are important challenges to be overcome, and choices to be made. The benefits and costs of open data must be weighed against those of other programs. Priorities must be established, especially at a time of constrained budgets. To borrow a phrase from the open source movement, open data is free not in the sense of free beer, but of air. Huge sums of money are involved in transitioning from a paper-based system to an open data universe with real time feeds. Cost-effective and efficient means of implementation need to be developed. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Implementation is critical, one of the most important challenges confronting the NHS. It is not enough just to know that data transparency has tremendous positive potential. We must also know how to maximize that potential, and how to overcome (or at least minimize) the risks that accompany it. Without a roadmap for implementation, the NHS—and the wider public—risks drowning in the “tsunami of data” that the government has promised.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Therefore, one of the central goals of this paper has been, precisely, to develop a roadmap for implementation of open data policies. We have outlined a conceptual framework, or logic model, that can help in this process. It breaks down the open data chain into seven component pieces: inputs, users, activities, outputs, outcomes, impacts, and methodologies. These seven components allow us to better analyze risks and opportunities, and to understand where (and how) an open data initiative might succeed or fail.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Perhaps the most important contribution of a conceptual model is that it allows us to measure the impact of open data. For all the hype surrounding the field, it remains in fact nascent, dominated by unproven hypotheses and assumptions.  The model presented here allows us to move beyond guesswork and into the realm of evidence-based policymaking. Importantly, the model allows us to continue gathering, analyzing and disseminating evidence about the <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">positive</span> impact of open data. The risks (e.g. to privacy) are real, and cannot be overlooked or minimized. But it is equally important, even as we acknowledge and seek to address these risks, that we continue to evaluate and better understand the tremendous positive potential of data transparency. Only such a positive agenda can help us design more effective open data policies. </p>
      <p class="ok_text">Ultimately, a conceptual model remains just that—a concept, or theory, that will require further analysis and data in order to become fleshed out and more concrete. Towards that end, we have suggested that the NHS should foster and create what we call an Open Data Learning Environment (ODLE). An ODLE represents the first step towards operationalizing the conceptual model. If implemented, it can lead to a culture of learning and improvement across the NHS. It would encourage responsiveness, agility, and flexibility in the way the NHS designs and implements its open data initiatives. In a word, an ODLE would help the NHS <span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">learn</span> from its own failures and successes.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">We submit this paper in the same spirit of learning, responsiveness and flexibility. What we have included here is just an initial proposal—the outlines of a model, the beginnings of a system for evaluation and measurement. Much work (much research, much data collection, much analysis) remains to be done, and this work can and should be used to refine the conceptual framework we have presented.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Part of this process of refinement also includes collecting and incorporating feedback from readers of this document. We very much look forward to your comments and suggestions. They will help improve our recommendations, and ultimately improve the way open data is collected, disseminated and used within the NHS.</p>

      <p class="ok_text">Open health data exists within a broader context. Big data taxonomies explain the relationship between open data and other types of data such as personal data. One example distills data into categories based on control: Open data commons, personal and proprietary data, and government secret data.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-216-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-216">216</a> </span>Categories within big data tend to overlap, signifying that in practice insights can be found by using each type in combination with one another. </p>

      <p class="ok_text">In his book, Joel Gurin fills in the overlapping combinations among big, government, and open data, all of which could fall in one of the three major categories below. For example, big data may not be open data and vice versa, which would then fall into personal or proprietary data or government secret data, depending on the source of control. </p>

      <p class="ok_text">Further, big, open, non-governmental data and big, open, governmental data both fall within the Open Data Commons, as openness is their defining factor. For the purposes of this paper, big data will be compiled into the three control-based categories here.</p>
      <p class="ok_text">Open Data Commons are made available to all with very little or no limitations on use. Most commons have been developed to help monitor the performance of specific policies. Pentland, et al explain that big data holds significant opportunity for the development of many more commons, which can be captured without human intervention and as a byproduct of other activities. Existing commons include geo-located and time-stamped statistics about aggregate costs, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g., mobility, smoking, drinking, crime, accidents). </p>
      <p class="ok_text"><span class="OK_italic _idGenChar2Override-1">Open Government Data</span> is the most important and promising subcategory of open data, and is released by the government for anyone’s use. Whether classified under the umbrella of big data or not, it can have a major impact when released. Examples include weather, census and GPS data, as well as agency or departmental data that helps people use city services like public buses or health clinics.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-217-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-217">217</a></span></p>
      <p class="ok_text">Personal and Proprietary Data are intrinsically more restrictive, as they are controlled by individuals or companies and require more stringent infrastructure, use, and auditing controls. They include digital breadcrumbs (mobility, call, and purchasing patterns, etc.), personal annotations about eating, subjective variables, and standard health data (temperature, glucose, genomic, etc.). </p>
      <p class="ok_text _idGenParaOverride-1">Government Secret Data typically includes private data such as tax data, detailed census and expenditure data, detailed healthcare system costs, and individual performance ratings. It is kept secret under the assumptions that the government is protecting the public and these types of information would be damaging if they were made public. Challenges arise with the collision of big data and health systems, as governments increase the amount of individual behavior data and other personal information.<span class="OK_sup"><a id="footnote-29809-218-backlink" class="_idFootnoteLink" href="#footnote-29809-218">218</a></span></p>

          <p class="ok_Footnote-text"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor" href="#footnote-29809-36-backlink">36</a> The research team reviewed in a systematic manner a variety of sources to establish the current framework and to develop a scan of the available evidence till date with regard to open data. The universe of sources included publications released by the UK government on open data, publications released by related and non-governmental agencies, publications released by foreign governments such as the US and international bodies, peer-reviewed research on healthcare and bioethics, and academic research on open data more generally. Through this collection of resources, the research team took a discursive approach, identifying keywords in the relevant literature, using these keywords to further define – or in some cases expand – their areas of study. Through this analysis the research team identified six broad areas of interest in the use of open data more generally, and its potential application in the healthcare industry: accountability and transparency, efficiency, choice and behavioral science, consumer advocacy and customer service, and economic growth and entrepreneurial innovation. These categories were then further refined in concert with the goals for the open data program, expressed by key NHS stakeholders.</p>
